# Introduction

Tween+ offers highly optimized networking for incredibly efficient server tweening.

To utilize it, you'll need to integrate it with my modified version of the [Packet](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/3573907) networking library.

If you're currently using a different networking library, consider switching — this one’s faster, more flexible, and built with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind.

New to networking libraries? Now's the perfect time to dive in. You'll be surprised by all the benefits.

Networking is not supported for plugins of course.
