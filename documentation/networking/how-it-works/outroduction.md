Obviously there's a bit more to it behind the scenes.

If you'd like to know more, you can always view Tween+'s source code â€” either on GitHub or in Studio. That way you can see exactly how everything works.

The network library's source code can also be found at [its GitHub](https://github.com/AlexanderLindholt/PacketPlus).

If you have any questions or ideas for improvement, be sure to let me know, and I'll be happy to listen!
