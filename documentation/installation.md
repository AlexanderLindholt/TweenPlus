# Installation

Let's first get the module. There are two main ways:

* [**Get it from the Roblox creator store**](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/100081703118723)**:**
  * Click `Get Model`.
  * Open the ToolBox in Roblox Studio.
  * Go to the `Inventory` tab.
  * Click on `Tween+` to insert.
* [**Get it from the GitHub repository**](https://github.com/AlexanderLindholt/TweenPlus/releases/latest)**:**
  * Download the `.rbxm` file.
  * Find the file in your file explorer.
  * Drag the file into Roblox Studio.



That's basically it for the installation!\
You can now place it wherever you want and start using it.
