# FPS

`FPS` is one of the many options.

It controls the playback target [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate).\
Defaults to infinite, meaning it will match the rest of the application.

{% hint style="info" %}
It can be used to create a cool stop-motion effect or simply to optimize animations by lowering the framerate.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
It does _not_ affect the actual target FPS of the application.
{% endhint %}
