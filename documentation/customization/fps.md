# FPS

The FPS is one of the customization options, and work just like all of the others.

As for what it actually does, it simply sets the playback target FPS to whatever you want. Keep this at `nil` for unlocked FPS of course.

It can be used to create a cool stop-motion effect or simply to optimize animations by lowering the FPS.
