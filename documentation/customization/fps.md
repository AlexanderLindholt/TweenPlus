# FPS

`FPS` is one of the many customization options.

It controls the playback target [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate).\
Defaults to infinite, meaning it will match the application (game or Studio).

{% hint style="info" %}
It can be used to create a cool stop-motion effect or simply to optimize animations by lowering the FPS.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
It does not affect the actual target FPS of the application.
{% endhint %}
