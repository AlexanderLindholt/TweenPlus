# Player-list library

Install the [Players+](https://github.com/AlexanderLindholt/PlayersPlus) library in your game.

You should already have Packet+ set up so you can skip that part :)

{% hint style="success" %}
Consider using it in your game for other purposes than Tween+, as it’s a simple but great library!
{% endhint %}
