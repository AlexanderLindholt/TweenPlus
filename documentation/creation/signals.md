# Signals

For signals to function, you have to install a signal library.

{% hint style="info" %}
[Signal+](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/3552231) is highly recommended for performance.
{% endhint %}

It's crucial that you give the module the [tag](https://create.roblox.com/docs/studio/properties#instance-tags) `Signal`, so that Tween+ can identify it.\
You can then place it wherever you want and start using signals.
